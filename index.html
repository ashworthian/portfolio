        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have a real passion for Web Design and Development but I am also a Graphics Designer first and foremost. In particular I hold over 13 years of Photoshop experience whilst my experience in HTML, CSS and Jacascript is relatively fresh.
          However
          I wish to pursue a career in this area. As such I would relish working in a development team and am currently available for opportunities.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/munch/"><img src="images/project1.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>Munch Project</h2>
        <p>This project was my first project in which I used basic HTML and CSS as an introduction to Web Design. The main theme for this was to design a website in the layout of a blog.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="proj">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/holidayvillas/"><img src="images/project2.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>DIY Project</h2>
        <p>In my second project I introduced columns as part of a DIY project. I continued to use HTML and CSS but with a few additional slightly advanced techniques. The main theme for this was for a Holiday Villa
          company.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="proj">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/granular/"><img src="images/project3.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>Granular Project</h2>
        <p>For my next project I begun to experiment with more varied CSS which included fixed positioning of a background image, the ability for scroll effects. This also included a Newsletter form and a pricing page. The main
          theme for this was an phone image app.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="proj">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/last-studio/"><img src="images/project4.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>Last-Studio Project</h2>
        <p>The following project I begun to include Javascript. The Javascript in question enabled the background to change as the page is scrolled. There was also a specialized columns CSS included for the image display. The
          main theme for this was a portfolio for a photographer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="proj">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/javascript-slider/"><img src="images/project5.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>Javascript Slider Project</h2>
        <p>For this project I made a 'presentation slider' based website that would change the information and attributes such as background color each time the next, random or previous buttons were clicked on. The main
          theme for this as such was a information slider.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="proj">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ashworthian.github.io/stprecious/"><img src="images/project6.png" alt="placeholder" /></a>
        <h2>Star Trek Project</h2>
        <p>On this project, I took various things that I have learned in HTML and CSS to create a website for a personal Star Trek writing project of mine. There are also a few techniques included that I have not previously used. However I intend to
          routinely add more to this project.</p>
